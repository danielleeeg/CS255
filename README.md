# Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DriverPass project was prompted by a client who noticed a deficit of online DMV training materials available to those who are preparing for driving exams. This project would include the design of a website that would allow end-users to take practice exams, view study materials, and schedule in-person driving sessions with drivers. The system would be available as a web-based site available for both desktop and mobile device formats.

# What did you do particularly well?
I think I described the non-functional requirements of the system quite well. I did a copious amount of research on how other companies and developers have handled similar applications.

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I were to revise one portion of my work, I would update the class diagram in the System Design Document to include class methods. Without these methods, it is not a truly complete representation of how the system should be structured.

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I read through the initial client interview notes countless times throughout the project as I was creating design documents. I was operating with the assumption that the DriverPass owner would have a good idea of what their target user audience wants in an application. Beyond their description, I put myself in the shoes of the end user. I have used many similar sites, so I thought about what features lead to a good experience. This is important because a bad site can drive users away. Ultimately, DriverPass is a business, so customer retention is highly important. 

# How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
When designing this software, I started with reading the interview transcript from the initial design meeting. From the information given, I was able to build a process model and an object model. This activity helped me think through the problem and the solution I wanted to implement. It also helped me describe the project in assignments throughout the course. Next, I made some more detailed diagrams, such as a use case diagram, class diagrams, activity diagrams, and sequence diagrams. Each of these diagrams helped to refine my thoughts and creativity surrounding the building of the app. I will certainly be creating diagrams for projects like this one moving forward.
